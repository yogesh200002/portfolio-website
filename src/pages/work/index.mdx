            At Lucio, an early-stage startup, I have been instrumental in refactoring the product's codebase, leading to a 50% improvement in performance through efficient optimization of components and libraries.
            Additionally, I revamped the user interface, significantly enhancing the overall user experience. My notable contributions include creating the KAMI AI dashboard and landing page.
            KAMI AI is an API as a service product that utilizes OCR technology to read and translate files, allowing users to query the document after processing.
