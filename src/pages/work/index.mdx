        I implemented state management, data fetching, routing, and form handling functionalities using industry-standard libraries, ensuring a smooth user experience and a maintainable codebase.
        My role required effective collaboration with cross-functional teams to deliver integrated solutions, showcasing my proficiency in both front-end and back-end development.
